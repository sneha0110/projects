      "During this pandemic crisis, where safety is the first priority, we bring a smart contactless Thermometer, that senses the temperature and alerts if it crosses the threshold temperature. This module has been made simpler by sensing the temperature when the user scans his/her id. The detected temperature is stored and monitored in the database that is integrated with the organization's ERP. This device works on Node MCU and sensors to detect the presence and temperature of the user and also with an RFID to scan the id and to store it in the database. ",

      "The open cloud is a cloud platform that is designed to help everyone in hosting their solutions to life. Build, run and manage applications across clouds, on-premises and at the edge, with the tools and frameworks of their choice. To run modern operating systems and apps, hardware older than 15 years was recovered from scrap, assembled, and modifications were made both on the hardware and software levels. Now, in Pattarai, we'll improve the present setup and turn it into a market product that's scalable, as well as construct a web application that includes all of the capabilities of our open cloud project and make it market-ready.",
